# Labs-AP1
Welcome to the repository, which contains laboratory works on the subject of algorithmization and programming from semester 1 cource 1.
## Lab 1
 Write the code of the program "Hello world!", modify the program so that it displays your last name on the console.
## Lab 2
 1. **Task 1.** Compose a function calculation program for different values ​​of its arguments. Enter arguments from the keyboard. Display the value of the function on the screen. Provide in the program a bypass of algebraic operations that can have an undefined result with certain values ​​of the arguments, that is, division by zero, extracting the root of an even power from a negative number, the logarithm of a negative number, and the like, while displaying a message on the screen that that the function is undefined.
 2. **Task 2.** Compose a function calculation program for different values ​​of its arguments. Enter arguments from the keyboard. Display the value of the function and the intermediate variable.
## Lab 3
 1. **Task 1.** Write a program to calculate the values ​​of the function for different values ​​of the argument (protabulate the function) on the specified segment using three loop statements. Calculate the definite integral of the function on the specified segment. Consider the value of the argument in the specified number of points, setting it as a preprocessor constant. Display the number in order, the value of the argument and the value of the function on the screen in columns, using the capabilities of the formatted output. Separately output the value of the calculated integral.
 2. **Task 2.** Write a program for the approximate calculation of the value of the function Y(x) at the point 0 < | x | < 1 using the Taylor series expansion S(x). Find the approximate value of the function with an error less than ε < 0.0001. Enter the values ​​of x and ε from the keyboard. Display the exact value of Y(x), the found approximate value of S(x) and the resulting error | S(x) – Y(x) |.
## Lab 4
 1. **Task 1.** Given a natural number N (set arbitrarily as a preprocessor constant) and a one-dimensional array A0, A1, …, AN-1 of integers (generate positive and negative elements randomly, using the <stdlib.h> library function rand()). Perform the following actions: determine the largest number of odd and the number of even numbers.
 2. **Task 2.** Write down the matrix of integers A(N,N) (randomly generate, set N arbitrarily as a preprocessor constant). Rearrange the columns of the matrix in reverse order.
## Lab 5
 1. **Task 1.** Enter your last name, first name and patronymic from the keyboard as one text data. Follow the steps below. Display the results on the screen. Output the name and the number of letters in the third word.
 2. **Task 2.** Enter character strings S1 and S2 up to 100 characters long from the keyboard. Follow the steps below. Display the results on the screen. Count the number of consonants in S1 and S2 that are surrounded by numbers on both sides.
## Lab 6
 1. **Task 1.** A dynamic line is entered from the keyboard, perform the following task. Use pointers when accessing elements. A string contains zero and one characters, count the number of zeros and ones. 
 2. **Task 2.** The text is given. Create an array of pointers to individual paragraphs. Sort them by length. Display the sorted paragraphs on the screen.
## Lab 7
 1. **Task 1.** Complete the tasks listed below. Input-output of data and execution of other separate logical actions must be implemented in separate functions. You only need to call them in the main function. The use of global variables is not allowed. Information should only be passed to functions via parameters. Using the halving method, find the root of the equation: 2^x - x - 2 = 0. Search on the interval [1,3]. Enter precision from the keyboard.
 2. **Task 2.** Perform text file analysis (any text). Input-output of data and execution of other separate logical actions must be implemented in separate functions. You only need to call them in the main function. The use of global variables is not allowed. Information should only be passed to functions via parameters. The name of the text file and other input data are specified in the program text. The output is output to the console. Calculate the frequency of punctuation marks (for each number and %).
## Lab 8
  1. **Task 1.** Compile a program that makes it possible to implement the solution of the given task using structures and associations. All input data is taken from a text file (create at least ten relevant entries in the file). Input-output of data and execution of other separate logical actions must be implemented in separate functions. You only need to call them in the main function. The use of global variables is not allowed. Information should only be passed to functions via parameters. Find books on the C++ algorithmic language in the bibliographic catalog. The book code, author's last name, title, year of publication and number of pages are entered in the catalog.
  2. **Task 2.** Develop a program that provides processing of data structures. It is necessary to ensure processing of 3-5 fields of elements using various simple data types (ribbons, symbols, numbers).<br />
Ensure the following operations:
- adding a new element;
- element search by field value;
- sequential viewing of elements;
- modification of element field values;
- deleting an element;
- sorting by field values.<br />
The results of all operations must be stored in a file (create at least ten relevant records in the file). Element Book (title, author, publisher, year, number of pages).
